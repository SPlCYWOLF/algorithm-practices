This repository follows a "one-algorithm-per-day" routine.

In other words, the goal is to solve at least one algorithm question everyday.



The questions are mainly from <a href="https://www.acmicpc.net/">Baekjoon</a> website, and <a href="https://swexpertacademy.com/main/main.do">SWEA</a> website.

As for now, python and Visual Studio Code (IDE) are used to solve the problems.

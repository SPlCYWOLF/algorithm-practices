## What I do


This repository follows a "one-algorithm-per-day" routine.

In other words, the goal is to solve at least one algorithm question everyday.

<br>

## How I do

The questions are from <a href="https://www.acmicpc.net/">Baekjoon</a>, <a href="https://programmers.co.kr/learn/challenges">Programmers</a>, and <a href="https://swexpertacademy.com/main/main.do">SWEA</a> website.

As for now, python and Pycharm (IDE) are mainly used to solve the problems.

However, solutions using Vanilla-JS is on the way as well.
